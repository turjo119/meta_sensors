#   Metamaterial Light Sensor

We propose a novel design for a metamaterial structure whose sensing capabilities are based on light-sensitive components. 
The aim was to create a metamaterial device whose sensors are able to take in light as raw
inputs, sense and process continuous deformation of the physical
structure, and utilize sensor fusion principles to visually replicate
the extent of deformation of the physical structure virtually in
software. Through our work, we have been able to determine the
capabilities of metamaterial light sensors as input devices in for
applications in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.
